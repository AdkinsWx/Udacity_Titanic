Investigating Titanic Survivor Data

## Project Objective
This Project will explore the demographics and passenger information provided for 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew that were on board the Titanic.

Data was provided as a CSV by Kaggle

## Project Questions
- What factors made people more likely to survive?
- Who was more likely to own a first class ticket?


## Data Wrangling
### Possible Issues with the Data
After viewing the table below we can see that not all data points are accounted for. For instance on Line [5], Mr. James Moran's age and cabin number are missing (Some even have multiple cabin numbers). It may be better to insert a 0 for the missing age and "Unknown" for the missing cabin number.
